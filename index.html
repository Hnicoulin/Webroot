My favorite hobbies to do in the fall/winter is bouldering, snowboarding, thrifting, hitting the gym, attending indoor concerts, go bar hopping and playing games on my switch. 

          Currently I am interested in cosplaying, video game development, true crime series, logic puzzles and makeup.

          <p>
            I am pretty new to coding in general. I took one class in highschool that I failed miserably and just recently started taking courses this past fall. My experiences are limited but some of my all time favorite projects were developing a web page that organizes your favorites trials with an interactive map and an HTML horror game.

            I hope this course can help solidify the things I have already learned into my long-term memory. I was worried about how much I would remember since I took the summer off. However, I am finding that simply talking about the terminology is helping me remember.
