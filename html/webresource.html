              <p>
                Validator w3 is free web development tool that provides an easy way to check your code for any errors. It can help identify missing attributes and closing tabs you may have missed. This will become espallaiy useful to me for when I am writing lengthy code for complex websites. A couple downsides of this website is you have to be an intermdeate coder to understand some of the errors and complients presented. As well as it may complain about somehtng you indetllenally choose to ignore. Overall a useful tool that I now have as a source to support me through my coding journey.

              <p>Free Code Camp is a free learn-to-code program that claims you’ll learn to code in 50 hours. They have certificates in sveral web/tech foucuses like responsive web design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data srtuctres, Front End Devlopment Libaraies, Data Visualization etc. Based off the reviews I read it seems to provide a basic foundation in Jquerey and Bootstrap, with a high regaurd for the Javascript section. The website is simply but inteactive making me want to use it and I will most likely be spending my free time in the summer on this website. I have always wanted a site that could supplement and expand my learning in coding but my fincances would always be the limiting factor. Free Code Camp is the crutch I need. </p>

              <div class="fw-bold"><a href = "https://replit.com">Replit</a></div>
              <p>Replit is a site I have been using for a while for web development. It is a code editor that is a simple version of Visual Studio Code. I think this is a useful webrescouce because it has a screen on the side that shows a preview of the website evrye time you click the run button. Since it is not on your local file I belive it is not possible to directly move files from within it to GitHub but none the less is a great way to try out code but not use so much memory. I find it especially useful since we are currently dealing with Covid and having to do classes online. My computer struggles sto run zoom and VSC at the same time. Replit allows me to keep up in class. However thisis very specific to my current situation of dealing with pansdimic resturicons and being a baby coder therefore I gave it the lowest rating out of the bunch. </p>

              <div class="fw-bold"><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA">Traversy Media</a></div>
              <p>Traversy Media is a youtuber proving detailed tutorails on web development. I think his youtube videos are particularly better than other ones I have seen because he has sections for topics with in his video that you can click ahead to. This is great for someone who wants a tip or an example on a epceiifc topic but don’t want to waste their time watching the whole video or worse, digging through it every 15 seconds trying to find the topic they are looking for. This mixture of convience, attention to details and as visiaul step by step provides another supplemnrtay tool for my journey in coding.

              <p>Test Dome is a third-party service linking coders/web developers with hrining companies through a serious of sample tests. They offer assessments for programming, IT, customer service, accounting, administration, and general mental ability. These provide its testers with a certification of sorts to put inthier rseumes as well as a candiate farm for companies. This is beffincal to the web devolpers because they can get a feel for what kind of questions/tests they may have to complete in the interview process. I particaully enjoy this site because it is free and I learn best through failure. So I am able to attempt these tests and fail until I devlope a better understanding of what will be expected from me and what I might need to work on to be ready. </p>
